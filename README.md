OMG, just finished The Accountant 2, and like... what did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩?? Ben Affleck is still all about those complicated math vibes, but now he's throwing punches like a champ on a caffeine trip. Seriously, dude never misses a rhythm when he's on screen. I kinda expected more plot, less brawn, but hey, who am I kidding? I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   'cause I expected action and got a ton of it. This sound right or am I just delirious?

> Like, there was this whole scene where stuff was supposed to make sense, and I swear I spaced out 'cause the dialogue just kept coming, and suddenly I hear a boom, and I'm back in it like, Oh, okay, we're exploding things now. Basically, it was a classic Affleck ride.

I mean, there were moments I vibed with, like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 him decode things while bullets fly past. I was kinda on the edge of my seat, then bam — plot twist that I think I missed 'cause I was lost in thought about pizza. You know what I mean?

And dude, the fight scenes... tell me they didn't look like something out of a video game. Affleck just, you know, smashes through everything. Kinda wish I had that power, except, like, for solving life's problems instead of breaking jaws.

Anyway, do they even need to solve a plot when you've got fists and numbers? It's like, here, have some random chaos with your adrenaline. I half-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 this thing thinking, Do I even follow, or is it just vibes now? Did I drift off for a sec, or get dazzled by all that symmetric violence?

string whatAmIDoingHere = Honestly no idea why I added this...;

But yeah, if you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , grab popcorn and a friend so you can laugh at the ridiculousness together. It’s a whole rollercoaster of a sequel. I'll probably re-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it when I've had enough sleep to tell scenes apart from my daydreaming. 😆
